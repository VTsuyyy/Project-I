# Project-I
This is subject project, it's about the problem TSP_large_scale. Because of its number of solutions is too much, near infinity so cannot find the best solution. Depend on your agorithm and the time exceed, it will output a different solution. My task is find my best agoritm about this problem.

# Installation
- Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements:
  + You have installed all C++ library.
  + Your computer has IDE, editor like Visual Studio Code, Dev C,...
- Then you just dowload this folder's zip and unzip it.
- Open this folder in your IDE and run the TSP_large.cpp file
- You must input number of vertexs (in here I have 11 test case) and  the time exceed limit (s)


Source: Inputs have graph I took from my Application algorithms subject.
The code was writed by me and use some knowledge I learnt from my Introdution to AI subject.
